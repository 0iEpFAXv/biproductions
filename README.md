# biproductions
This library is intended to support creating production rules for two languages together.  Another way to say this is that the biproduction templates cover a domain (language) I while simultaneously labelling the values from that domain in language R.

The biproduction library is implemented in Haskell, with applications written in ghci jupyter notebooks.
